# useMemo 🎒

Notes:
 - `useMemo` returns a memoized value.
 - Call signature: `const memoizedValue = useMemo(functionThatReturnsValue, arrayDepencies)`
 - View the [docs.](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo)

## Starter Example

<Editor noInline code={Starter} />

The example above is similar to the one for [useCallback](/usecallback). 

The only difference here is that `someValue` is an object NOT a string. 
Owing to this, the `Instructions` component still re-renders despite the use of `React.memo`.

Why? 

Objects are compared by reference, and the reference to `someValue` changes whenever `<App />` re-renders.

Any solutions?

## Basic Usage

The object, `someValue` may be memoized using `useMemo`. This prevents the needless re-render.
