# useEffect 🦋
 
> Notes: 
 - `useEffect` accepts a function which can perform any side effects.      
 - [View docs.](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect) 

## Basic Side Effect 
<Editor code={BasicEffect}/>

## Effect with Cleanup 
It's pretty common to clean up an effect after some time. This is possible by returning a function from within the effect function passed to `useEffect`. 
Below's an example with `addEventListener`.
<Editor code={EffectCleanup}/>

## Multiple Effects 
Multiple `useEffect` calls can happen within a functional component as shown below: 
<Editor code={MultipleEffects}/>

> useEffect calls can be skipped i.e not invoked on every render. 
 This is done by passing a second array argument to the effect function. 


## Skipping Effects (Array Dependency) 
In the example below, `useEffect` is passed an array of one value, `[randomNumber]`
Hence, the effect function will be called on mount **and** whenever a new "randomNumber" is generated. 

Click the "Generate random number" button to see this. 

<Editor code={ArrayDep}/>

## Skipping Effects (Empty Array Dependency )
In this example, `useEffect` is passed an empty array, `[]`. 
Hence, the effect function will be called only on mount. 

Click the button and you'll see that the effect function isn't invoked. 

<Editor code={ArrayDepMount}/>

## Skipping Effects (No array dependency)
Without an array dependency, the effect function will be run after every single render. 

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("This will be logged after every render!")
})
```
