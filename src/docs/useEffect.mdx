> Ideas for sharing: 
- Hooks have a simple API and you can view them with live editable examples here. 
- Here's a one-stop reference for hooks. A cheatsheet with live editable examples.    
[View docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect) 

## Basic Side Effect 
<Editor code={BasicEffect}/>

## Effect with Cleanup 
<Editor code={EffectCleanup}/>

## Multiple Effects 
<Editor code={MultipleEffects}/>

## Skipping Effects (Array Dependency)
In this example, `useEffect` is passed an array with one value, `[randomNumber]`
Hence, the effect function will be called on mount **and** whenever a new "randomNumber" is generated. 

Click the "Generate random number" button to see this. 

<Editor code={ArrayDep}/>

## Skipping Effects (Empty Array Dependency )
In this example, `useEffect` is passed an empty array, `[]`. Hence, the effect function will be called only on mount. 

Click the button and you'll see that the effect function isn't invoked. 

<Editor code={ArrayDepMount}/>

## Skipping Effects (No array dependency)
Without an array dependency, the effect function will be run after every single render. 

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("This will be logged after every render!")
})
```
